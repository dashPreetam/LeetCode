### Using Hashmap

1. Initialize an empty hashmap.
1. Run a loop through the entire array.
1. If the hashmap contains the current element as a key, do step 4 else do step 5.
1. Store the current element, and the value of the current key from the hashmap in the result array.
5. Store the current element target in the hashmap with the difference between the current element as the key and repeat step 3 for rest of the elements.
6. Return result array.
